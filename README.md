## About

This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).
